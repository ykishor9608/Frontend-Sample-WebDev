                <p>INS Vikramaditya (lit.â€‰'Valour Comparable to the Sun') is a modified Kiev-class aircraft carrier and the
                    flagship of the Indian Navy. The carrier entered into service in 2013.</p>

                <p>Originally built as Baku and commissioned in 1987, the carrier served with the Soviet Navy and later with ...
                    <!-- the Russian Navy (as Admiral Gorshkov) before being decommissioned in 1996.[20][21][22] After years of
                    negotiations, the carrier was purchased by India on 20 January 2004.[1] The transformed ship completed
                    her sea trials in July 2013[23] and first STOBAR aviation trials in September 2013.</p>

                <p>She was commissioned on 16 November 2013 at a ceremony held at Severodvinsk, Russia.[25] On 14 June 2014,
                    the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, formally inducted INS Vikramaditya into the Indian Navy.</p>

                    <dt>The deal</dt>
                    <dd>Baku entered service in 1987, renamed Admiral Gorshkov in 1991, but was deactivated in 1996 because
                        she was too expensive to operate on a post-Cold War budget. This attracted the attention of India,
                        which was looking for a way to expand its carrier aviation capabilities.[28] On 20 January 2004,
                        after years of negotiations, Russia and India signed a deal for the sale of the ship. The ship would
                        be free, while India would pay US$800 million for the upgrade and refit of the vessel and an
                        additional US$1 billion for the aircraft and weapons systems. The navy looked at equipping the
                        carrier with the E-2C Hawkeye, but decided not to.[29] In 2009, Northrop Grumman offered the
                        advanced E-2D Hawkeye to the Indian Navy.

                        The deal also included the purchase of 12 single-seat Mikoyan MiG-29K "Fulcrum-D" (Product 9.41) and
                        four dual-seat MiG-29KUB aircraft (with an option for 14 more aircraft) at US$1 billion, six Kamov
                        Ka-31 "Helix" reconnaissance and antisubmarine helicopters, torpedo tubes, missile systems, and
                        artillery units. Facilities and procedures for training pilots and technical staff, delivery of
                        simulators, spare parts, and establishment maintenance on Indian Navy facilities were also part of
                        the contract.

                        The upgrade involved stripping all the weaponry and missile launcher tubes from the ship's foredeck
                        to make way for a "short take-off but arrested recovery" (STOBAR) configuration,[31] converting the
                        Gorshkov from a hybrid carrier/cruiser to a pure carrier. -->
